# Money-Laundering-Detection-Using-Alteryx
This repository contains an Alteryx workflow designed to detect suspicious financial transactions related to money laundering. It applies data transformation and predictive modelling, using Neural Networks and Boosted Models on synthetic data for enhanced anti-money laundering (AML) strategies.

# Project Title:
Money Laundering Detection Using Alteryx

# Description:
This project focuses on detecting and analysing suspicious financial transactions related to money laundering. The workflow applies predictive modelling techniques to identify high-risk transactions within a synthetic dataset that mimics real-world financial activities. The goal is to enhance anti-money laundering (AML) strategies by identifying patterns and anomalies in transactional data.

# Alteryx Tools Used:
Data Preparation: Filter, Join, Union, Formula
Predictive Modelling: Boosted Models, Neural Networks, Linear Regression
Data Cleansing: Select, Data Standardisation
Data Transformation: Summarise, Sort, Multi-Row Formula
Automation: Workflow Execution with Iterative Macros

# How to Run:
Download the money_laundering_detection.yxmd Alteryx workflow file.
Open the workflow in Alteryx Designer.
Connect the provided synthetic transaction dataset or use your own transaction data.
Run the workflow to analyse and flag suspicious financial transactions based on risk levels.

# Project Outcomes:
Successfully identified and flagged high-risk transactions based on predictive modelling.
Improved detection accuracy using Neural Networks and Boosted Models, with enhanced transaction risk profiling.
Demonstrated the effectiveness of Alteryx tools in automating and streamlining the AML detection process for large-scale financial datasets.
